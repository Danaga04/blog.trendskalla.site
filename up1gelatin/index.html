    <h1 class="center-text">First, take a deep breath. <br>You can finally stop searching.</h1>

    <p>You made the right choice. By securing the <strong>Gelatin Burn Protocol</strong>, you’ve just done what millions of women struggle to do for decades: you’ve claimed the "Master Key" to your metabolic health.</p> 
    
    <p>You are now part of an elite group of women who understand that weight loss isn't about "willpower"—it’s about chemistry. By activating your natural GLP-1 and GIP pathways through our specific bariatric gelatin sequence, you are turning on a biological furnace that has likely been dormant since your 20s.</p>

    <p>I want you to imagine your life just 14 days from this very moment.</p>

    <p>You wake up, and for the first time in years, that heavy, "puffy" feeling in your face and hands is gone. You walk to the mirror, and the inflammation that used to make your waist feel tight and restricted has vanished. You slide into a pair of jeans—the ones you kept in the "someday" pile at the back of your closet—and they zip up without you having to lay on the bed or hold your breath.</p>

    <p>When you go out for lunch, you’ll notice something strange: the "food noise" is silent. You aren’t white-knuckling your way through a salad while staring at your friend’s fries. You are genuinely, deeply satisfied. You have more energy at 4:00 PM than you used to have at 9:00 AM. Your husband looks at you a little longer; your friends ask what "work" you’ve had done.</p>

    <p class="highlight">This is the power of GLP-1 activation. This is your new reality.</p>

    <p>However, as a specialist who has seen thousands of women start this journey, I have a professional responsibility to be completely honest with you. While you have successfully <strong>activated</strong> the fire, we now have to make sure your body doesn't move to put it out.</p> 
    
    <p>There is a hidden biological "tripwire" that stops 80% of women from keeping their results, and we need to address it right now, before your first recipe even hits your system.</p>

    <h2>The Metabolic Reversal Window</h2>

    <p>There is a window of time that determines whether you lose weight for a month... or whether you transform your body for life. <strong>It lasts exactly 90 days.</strong></p>

    <p>You see, your body has something called <strong>"Adipose Memory."</strong> For the last several years, your hormones—specifically Cortisol, Insulin, and Leptin—have agreed on a "set point." Your brain thinks your current weight is your "safe" weight.</p>

    <p>The moment the Gelatin Burn Protocol begins to work—the moment your fat cells begin to shrink and your GLP-1 levels soar—your body is going to panic. It doesn't see "progress"; it sees a "survival threat."</p>

    <p>If you do not <strong>consolidate</strong> your hormones during this 90-day window, your body will fight back with three devastating "Rebound Triggers":</p>

    <div class="feature-box">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Adaptive Thermogenesis:</strong> Your brain detects the fat loss and sends a signal to your thyroid to slow down your resting heart rate and metabolism to "save energy." You stop losing weight, even if you eat nothing.</li>
            <li><strong>The Cortisol Spike:</strong> Rapid fat loss can trigger a rise in stress hormones. This "Survival Stress" tells your body to specifically store fat around your midsection to protect your internal organs, leading to the dreaded "menopausal belly" even as you lose weight elsewhere.</li>
            <li><strong>GLP-1 Desensitization:</strong> Just like caffeine, your body can become "numb" to its own GLP-1 signals if they aren't stabilized. This is why many women lose 10 pounds quickly and then hit a wall for months.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>This is the "Yo-Yo Trap." It’s why you’ve lost the same 20 pounds five times in the last decade. Your body is like a rubber band; the further you pull it (the more weight you lose), the harder it wants to snap back to its old, heavy shape.</p>

    <p>To make this change permanent, we cannot just activate your metabolism. We must <strong>reprogram</strong> it. We have to teach your brain that the "New, Thinner You" is the only "You" it’s allowed to remember.</p>

    <h2>Introducing: The Metabolic Reset Accelerator</h2>

    <p>This is why I’ve developed the <strong>Metabolic Reset Accelerator</strong>. Think of the Gelatin Burn Protocol as the "Ignition." The Accelerator is the "Autopilot" that keeps the plane in the air until you reach your destination.</p>
    
    <p>This is a 90-Day Hormonal Consolidation System designed specifically to bypass your body’s "Rebound Triggers" and lock in your new metabolic rate forever.</p>

    <p>We achieve this through a sophisticated, 3-Phase approach that mirrors the natural 90-day cycle of human cell regeneration:</p>

    <div class="phase-box">
        <h3>Phase 1: Hormonal Amplification (Days 1–21)</h3>
        <p>During these first three weeks, your body is in "Shock Mode." The Accelerator provides specific, micro-adjustments to your gelatin timing and supplemental "hormone-hacks" that double your GLP-1 signaling. This ensures that the "hunger-stopping" signal is so loud your brain cannot ignore it, effectively silencing "food noise" and crushing sugar cravings before they start.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phase-box">
        <h3>Phase 2: Metabolic Stabilization (Days 22–60)</h3>
        <p>This is where we "Lock the Thermostat." We focus on lowering your systemic inflammation and stabilizing your cortisol levels. By doing this, we prevent your body from entering "survival mode." We are effectively teaching your metabolism that this lower weight is your "New Normal." This phase prevents the dreaded plateau and ensures the fat keeps melting off your hips, thighs, and waist without your body fighting back.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="phase-box">
        <h3>Phase 3: Identity Lock & Fat Memory Reprogramming (Days 61–90)</h3>
        <p>In the final phase, we perform what we call "Biological Coding." We use specific metabolic sequences to "erase" your fat cell memory. By the end of Day 90, your body no longer remembers being 20, 30, or 50 pounds heavier. Your hormones are recalibrated to maintain your new, lean physique as your default state. This is how you stop "dieting" and simply start living as a thin person.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="price-section">
        <p>If you were to go to a high-end metabolic clinic to receive this kind of 90-day supervised hormonal consolidation, you would easily pay <strong>$2,500 to $5,000</strong>.</p>
        <p>If you were to use the popular pharmaceutical injections to achieve this, you’d be looking at $1,200 every single month—and the moment you stop the injections, the "Rebound Trigger" hits because your hormones weren't stabilized.</p>
        
        <p>You’ve already invested in the Gelatin Burn Protocol. You have the tools to start the fire. Now, I want to give you the insurance policy that ensures that fire keeps burning until every ounce of unwanted fat is gone—and stays gone.</p>

        <p>For today only, you can add the Metabolic Reset Accelerator to your order for a single payment of just:</p>

        <span class="new-price">$49</span>

        <p style="font-size: 16px;">(One-time payment. No monthly fees.)</p>

    <p class="center-text">Think about that. For less than the cost of a single dinner out at a restaurant, you are protecting your health, your confidence, and your future. You are ensuring that this is the last time you ever have to buy a weight loss product.</p>

    <p>This is NOT mandatory. If you want to try to navigate the "Metabolic Reversal Window" on your own, you are free to do so. But the women who are truly serious about never seeing those numbers on the scale again—the women who are tired of the heartbreak of the yo-yo effect—choose the Accelerator.</p>

    <p class="highlight center-text"><strong>Please Note:</strong> This is a one-time offer. This page will disappear the moment you leave it. You will never see the Metabolic Reset Accelerator at this $49 price point ever again.</p>

    <p>I am so confident that this will be the "missing piece" to your success that I am extending your existing guarantee to cover this system as well. If you don't feel your metabolism "locking in"—if you don't feel a level of control over your hunger and energy that you've never felt before—I don't want your money.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 20px;">Don't let your body's "Fat Memory" win this time. Secure your results. Lock in your metabolism. Finish what you started.</p>
