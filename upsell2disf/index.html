            <p><strong>Congratulations.</strong></p>
            <p>You just made the decision that 99% of men are too proud, too scared, or too ignorant to make.</p>
            <p>You're fixing your erection. You're getting your calibrated protocol. You're taking control of your sexual health.</p>
            <p>And I need you to breathe easy right now.</p>
            <p>Because here's what I can promise you:</p>
            <p>The main protocol WILL restore your erectile function. The Calibration Protocol WILL accelerate your results. The science is bulletproof. The mechanism works.</p>
            <p>You're going to wake up with morning wood again. You're going to feel blood rushing where it should. You're going to walk into the bedroom with confidence you haven't felt in years.</p>
            <p>You've already won the hardest battle.</p>
            <p>The plaque is getting cleared. The blood is flowing. Your penis is coming back to life.</p>
            <p>But now I need to tell you something that nobody else will.</p>
            <p>Something uncomfortable. Something most men discover too late.</p>
            <p>Something that separates the guy who "can get hard again" from the guy who becomes absolutely unforgettable in bed.</p>

            <p>Here's the brutal truth that no man wants to hear:</p>
            <p><strong>Having an erection is NOT the same as knowing what to do with it.</strong></p>
            <p>And here's the data that proves it:</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <ul class="arrow-list">
                    <li>75-80% of women do NOT achieve orgasm from penetration alone (Journal of Sexual Medicine, 2017)</li>
                    <li>Women in same-sex relationships report 86% orgasm rate vs 65% in heterosexual relationships (Archives of Sexual Behavior, 2018)</li>
                    <li>Only 18% of women say penetration is enough for complete satisfaction (Indiana University Study, 2020)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Let me translate that for you:</p>
            <p><strong>4 out of 5 women are NOT getting satisfied by a hard dick alone.</strong></p>
            <p>They're faking it. They're lying. They're protecting your ego.</p>
            <p>And you know how I know they're faking?</p>
            <p>Because when women sleep with women — when the entire experience is built around understanding female anatomy instead of just "penetrate and hope" — their orgasm rate jumps to 86%.</p>
            <p>That's a 21% difference.</p>
            <p>Not because "women understand women better."</p>
            <p>But because they've learned techniques that most men are never taught:</p>

            <ul class="arrow-list">
                <li>Where EXACTLY the clitoral structure extends (it's 4 inches long internally — most men only touch the tip)</li>
                <li>The difference between A-spot, G-spot, U-spot, and PS-spot stimulation (yes, there are FOUR major internal zones)</li>
                <li>How to combine clitoral + internal stimulation simultaneously (this is what causes "stacked" orgasms)</li>
                <li>The precise finger movements that trigger female ejaculation (it's a learnable technique, not luck)</li>
                <li>Tongue patterns and suction combinations that make her eyes roll back (there's actual science here)</li>
                <li>Strategic positioning that lets you hit angles the average man never reaches</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And here's what kills me:</p>
            <p>You're about to invest hundreds of dollars to get your erection back.</p>
            <p>You're going to follow the protocol. Take the supplements. Do everything right.</p>
            <p>And in 7-14 days, you're going to have a rock-hard erection again.</p>
            <p>But when you get in bed with her...</p>
            <p><strong>What are you going to DO with it?</strong></p>
            <p>Are you going to:</p>

            <ul class="cross-list">
                <li>Pump away for 5-10 minutes while she "ooohs" and "ahhhs" to make you feel good?</li>
                <li>Finish, roll over, and ask "was it good for you?" while she lies through her teeth?</li>
                <li>Wonder why she never initiates sex even though you "fixed" your ED?</li>
                <li>Notice her touching herself after you fall asleep because she didn't actually finish?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Because here's the thing most men never realize:</p>
            <p>She's not going to TELL you she didn't come.</p>
            <p>She's not going to TEACH you what actually works.</p>
            <p>She's going to protect your ego, fake enthusiasm, and quietly resent the mediocre sex.</p>
            <p>And you'll never know.</p>
            <p>You'll think, "Hey, I got my erection back, mission accomplished!"</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, she's thinking about her ex who "wasn't as hard" but somehow made her come three times in a row because he actually knew where to touch her.</p>
            <p>This is the uncomfortable reality:</p>
            <p>Erectile dysfunction gave you an excuse.</p>
            <p>"I can't perform because I can't get hard."</p>
            <p>But once that excuse is gone...</p>
            <p>Once you CAN get hard...</p>
            <p>You're exposed.</p>
            <p>If she's not satisfied, it's not because of your dick anymore.</p>
            <p>It's because you don't know what the fuck you're doing.</p>
            <p>And that's a harder pill to swallow than any Viagra.</p>

            <p>Now here's the good news:</p>
            <p><strong>Sexual skill is 100% learnable.</strong></p>
            <p>It's not about "intuition" or "listening to her body" or any of that vague bullshit.</p>
            <p>It's about specific techniques applied to specific anatomy in specific sequences.</p>
            <p>Just like you learned that ED is caused by blocked arteries (not "low T" or "getting old"), you can learn the EXACT physiological mechanisms that cause female orgasm.</p>
            <p>And once you know them?</p>
            <p>You become the guy she can't stop thinking about.</p>
            <p>The guy she brags about to her friends (in private).</p>
            <p>The guy who ruined her for other men.</p>
            <p>Not because of your dick size. Not because of how long you last.</p>
            <p>Because you know her body better than she does.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Introducing: The Advanced Intimacy Protocol</strong></p>
            
            <p>This is NOT a "be romantic and communicate" course.</p>
            <p>This is NOT "10 sex positions to try tonight."</p>
            <p>This is a clinical, scientific breakdown of female sexual physiology and the exact techniques that reliably produce orgasms — the same techniques that give women in same-sex relationships an 86% orgasm rate.</p>
            <p>We reverse-engineered what actually works. Studied the research. Interviewed sex therapists. Analyzed thousands of hours of clinical data.</p>
            <p>And we built a step-by-step protocol that teaches you:</p>

            <p>Here's what you need to understand:</p>
            <p>You're about to have your erection back.</p>
            <p>Maybe in 3 days. Maybe in 7. Maybe in 14.</p>
            <p>But it's coming.</p>
            <p>And when it does, you have two choices:</p>
            
            <p><strong>PATH 1: Wing It</strong></p>
            <p>Go into the bedroom with a hard dick and hope for the best.</p>
            <p>Do what you've always done. Assume penetration is enough. Finish in 10 minutes and ask "was it good?"</p>
            <p>She'll say yes. She'll smile. She'll cuddle.</p>
            <p>And she'll never tell you the truth.</p>
            <p>You'll never know if you're actually good or just "good enough."</p>
            <p>You'll never know if she's satisfied or settling.</p>
            <p>You'll have your erection back, but you won't have mastery.</p>

            <p><strong>PATH 2: Become Undeniable</strong></p>
            <p>Learn the actual anatomy. Master the techniques. Follow the protocols.</p>
            <p>Walk into the bedroom with your hard dick AND the knowledge of exactly where to touch, how to move, when to speed up, when to slow down.</p>
            <p>Make her come before penetration. Make her come during penetration. Make her come again after you finish.</p>
            <p>Become the guy she brags about. The guy she initiates with. The guy who ruined her for everyone else.</p>
            <p>Not because of your dick.</p>
            <p>Because you know what the fuck you're doing.</p>
